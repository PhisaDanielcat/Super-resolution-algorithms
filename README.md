# Super-resolution algorithm of pictures
Including nearest neighbor algorithm, bilinear interpolation and bicubic interpolation
This project is constructed in Pycharm environment
## States
    origin.bmp is the high resolution picture ready for comparing.
    downsampling.bmp is the low- resolution picture ready for changing.
## Usage
    1. pip install -r requirements.txt
    2. python xxx.py 
        will generate xxx.bmp which is generated by corresponding algorithm.
    3. python Measure.py 
        to run comparing program. Each picture costs about 5 seconds.
